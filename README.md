Group CYOA with Styles

Created multiple web pages as a team in the theme of Resident Evil games. Each group member did a unique story from a unique game, each with a bad, nuetral, and good ending. Complete with a main menu page and options to choose a CYOA from Resident Evil 2, 3, and 5. 

Peer Review: 
Good Job! I like the theme. I like how there are three different games with their own unique endings. Only criticism is there are slight grammer errors but that's it, simple mistake.
