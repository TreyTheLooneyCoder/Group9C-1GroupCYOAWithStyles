            You make your way into the tunnel and travel on feet for hours fearing that if you stop that "thing" will
            catch up to you. You keep walking and sundenly you start to hear a voice, a man talking to himself. you try
            to sneak passed unseen but are caught in the reflection of a metal box, he tells you not to move and to put
            your hands in the air, when you do he lowers his weapon. He says "Good you're not one of those things, my
            names carlos, nice to meet ya."
